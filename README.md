# Dataset

We utilize three multimodal knowledge graph datasets:

- **MMKG:** FB15K-DB15K, FB15K-YAGO15K

- **Multi-OpenEA:** EN-FR-V1, EN-DE-V1, D-W-V1, D-W-V2

- **DBP15K:** ZH-EN, JA-EN, FR-EN

Basic information of these datasets is introduced above. For additional visual information related to them, please refer to the content placed [here](https://pan.quark.cn/s/9c929a93683e).
